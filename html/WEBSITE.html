        <h3><i>I-INTRODUCTION</i></h3>
        <p>The "A Pet Named Steve" meme originated from a video by popular YouTuber Markiplier, where he played a game called Google Feud. In the video, Markiplier entered a funny answer, "A Pet Named Steve," which amused him greatly. This phrase quickly caught on among Markiplier's fans and the wider gaming community, becoming a recurring joke. People now use the meme to refer to imaginary pets or as a humorous response in various online discussions. The meme's popularity can be attributed to Markiplier's infectious laughter and the fondness his fans have for his comedic moments.</p>
